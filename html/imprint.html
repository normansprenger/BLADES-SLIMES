            <p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong><br><br><strong>Liability for content</strong><br><br>
                The content of our pages has been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the
                accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our
                own content on these pages according to § 7 Abs.1 TMG under general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG,
                we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate
                circumstances indicating illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under
                general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in
                time at which a concrete infringement becomes known. Upon becoming aware of such infringements, we will
                remove this content immediately.<br><br><strong>Liability for links</strong><br><br>
                Our offer contains links to external third-party websites, on whose content we have no influence.
                Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or
                operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were
                checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at
                the time of linking. However, a permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without
                concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such
                links immediately.<br><br><strong>Copyright</strong><br><br>
                The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law.
                Duplication, processing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright

                marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, we request that you
                notify us accordingly. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such content
                immediately.<br><br><strong>Data protection</strong><br><br>
